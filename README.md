This is an old project that I wrote when I was learning C / C++. It features modular sound synthesis and playback.
Includes a parser for presets and a sequencer. Written in C, C++, lex and yacc. If you are looking to create your own
modular synthesiser in C++ then this would be a good starting point.

Note: does not use modern C++ arrays.

See the "GPL3.txt" file for licence details.
